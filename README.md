**Critical Reviews:**
*Matt Wayt*
> What an annoyance to have a 'Transformers' movie with well-drawn humans, only to have them choke on the exhaust fumes of franchise expectations.

*David Griffiths*
> Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a film that will be enjoyed by hardcore Transformers films and because of the re-boot vibe is easily accessible to those who haven’t seen the other films.

*Dan Buffa*
> After Michael Bay tarnished the essence of the Autobot spirit with his soul-draining movies, Steven Caple Jr. returns some pride to the Hasbro warriors. He does that by keeping the focus on the robots, and not the humans.

*Bruce R. Miller*
> If you’ve been down the path several times before, you’ll realize they never really did figure out the Transformers’ purpose. Sometimes a cool toy is just that.
